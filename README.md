## Getting started

If you have your project set up with an `MKMapView`, integrating clustering will take 4 lines of code:

<pre>
<b>#import "CCHMapClusterController.h"</b>

@interface ViewController()

<b>@property (strong, nonatomic) CCHMapClusterController *mapClusterController;</b>

@end

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
  [super viewDidLoad]

  NSArray annotations = ...
  <b>self.mapClusterController = [[CCHMapClusterController alloc] initWithMapView:self.mapView];
  [self.mapClusterController addAnnotations:annotations withCompletionHandler:NULL];</b>
}
</pre>

<p align="center" >
  <img src="MapClustering.png" alt="Map Clustering" title="Map Clustering"/>
</p>

Don't worry about manually updating the clusters; `CCHMapClusterController` automatically knows when changes have occurred that require the clusters to regroup.

To try out the clustering, experiment with the example included in this project, or download the app “Stolpersteine in Berlin” [![Download on the App Store](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-sm.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/stolpersteine-in-berlin/id640731757?mt=8&uo=4).

### Installation

Use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to easily integrate `CCHMapClusterController` into your project. Minimum deployment targets are 7.0 for iOS and 10.9 for OS X.

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "CCHMapClusterController"
```

```ruby
platform :osx, '10.9'
pod "CCHMapClusterController"
```

### Performance

The clustering algorithm splits a rectangular area of the map into a grid of square cells. For each cell, a representation for the annotations in this cell is selected and displayed.

The quad tree implementation used to gather annotations for a cell is based on [TBQuadTree](https://github.com/thoughtbot/TBAnnotationClustering/blob/master/TBAnnotationClustering/TBQuadTree.h) and is very fast. For this reason, performance is less dependent on the number of clustered annotations, but rather on the number of visible clusters on the map. This number can be configured with the cell size and the margin factor (see below).

Other factors are the density of the clustered annotations (annotations spread over a large area cluster faster) and the way annotation views are implemented (if possible, use images instead of `drawRect:`).

The example in this project contains two data sets for testing: 5000+ annotations in a small area around Berlin and 80000+ annotations spread over the entire US. Both data sets perform fine on an iPhone 4S.

### Cell size and margin factor

`CCHMapClusterController` has a property `cellSize` to configure the size of the cell in points (1 point = 2 pixels on Retina displays). This way, you can select a cell size that is large enough to display map icons with minimal overlap. More likely, however, you will choose the cell size to optimize clustering performance (the larger the size, the better the performance). The actual cell size used for clustering will be adjusted so that the map's width is a multiple of the cell size. This avoids realignment of cells when panning across the 180th meridian.

The `marginFactor` property configures the additional map area around the visible area that's included for clustering. This avoids sudden changes at the edges of the visible area when the user pans the map. Ideally, you would set this value to 1.0 (100% additional map area on each side), as this is the maximum scroll area a user can achieve with a panning gesture. However, this affects performance as this will cover 9x the map area for clustering. The default is 0.5 (50% additional area on each side).

To debug these settings, set the `debugEnabled` property to `YES`. This will display the clustering grid over the map.

### Custom annotation views

Cluster annotations are of type `CCHMapClusterAnnotation`. Apart from implementing the `MKAnnotation` protocol, this class' property `annotations` exposes an array of annotations contained in the cluster. `CCHMapClusterAnnotation` also has two properties that can help you categorize the cluster annotation: `isCluster` returns `YES` if the cluster annotation has more than one annotation and `isUniqueLocation` if all annotations in this cluster have the same location.

Customizing the look of cluster annotations is possible via the standard `mapView:viewForAnnotation:` method that's part of `MKMapViewDelegate`.

```Objective-C
- (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id<MKAnnotation>)annotation
{
    MKAnnotationView *annotationView;

    if ([annotation isKindOfClass:CCHMapClusterAnnotation.class]) {
        ...
        annotationView = clusterAnnotationView;
    }

    return annotationView;
}
```

In addition, the delegate method `mapClusterController:willReuseMapClusterAnnotation:` is called when a cluster annotation is reused for a cell. The reused cluster annotation will have the same location as before, but will contain different annotations. This avoids annotations moving around while adding more data (see the property `reuseExistingClusterAnnotations` below on how to disable this behavior).

Make sure that you implement both `mapView:viewForAnnotation:` and `mapClusterController:willReuseMapClusterAnnotation:` to always have the annotation view in a consistent state.

```Objective-C
- (void)mapClusterController:(CCHMapClusterController *)mapClusterController willReuseMapClusterAnnotation:(CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)mapClusterAnnotation
{
    ClusterAnnotationView *clusterAnnotationView = (ClusterAnnotationView *)[self.mapView viewForAnnotation:mapClusterAnnotation];
    ...
}
```

The iOS example contains code that demonstrates how to display the current cluster size as part of the annotation view.

### Custom titles and subtitles for callouts

You can customize titles and subtitles used for their callouts by registering as a `CCHMapClusterControllerDelegate` with `CCHMapClusterController` and implementing two delegate methods.

In these methods, `CCHMapClusterAnnotation` gives you access to the annotations contained in the cluster through the property `annotations`. An annotation in this array will always implement `MKAnnotation`, but is otherwise of same type as the instances you added to `CCHMapClusterController` when calling `addAnnotations:withCompletionHandler:`.

Here is an example:

```Objective-C
- (NSString *)mapClusterController:(CCHMapClusterController *)mapClusterController titleForMapClusterAnnotation:(CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)mapClusterAnnotation
{
    NSUInteger numAnnotations = mapClusterAnnotation.annotations.count;
    NSString *unit = numAnnotations > 1 ? @"annotations" : @"annotation";
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%tu %@", numAnnotations, unit];
}

- (NSString *)mapClusterController:(CCHMapClusterController *)mapClusterController subtitleForMapClusterAnnotation:(CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)mapClusterAnnotation
{
    NSUInteger numAnnotations = MIN(mapClusterAnnotation.annotations.count, 5);
    NSArray *annotations = [mapClusterAnnotation.annotations.allObjects subarrayWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, numAnnotations)];
    NSArray *titles = [annotations valueForKey:@"title"];
    return [titles componentsJoinedByString:@", "];
}
```

### Positioning cluster annotations

For aesthetic reasons, cluster annotations are not lined up evenly as this would make the underlying grid obvious. This library comes with two implementations to configure the position of cluster annotations:

- `CCHCenterOfMassMapClusterer` (default): computes the average of the coordinates of all annotations in a cluster
- `CCHNearCenterMapClusterer`: uses the position of the annotation in a cluster that's closest to the center

Instances of these classes can be assigned to `CCHMapClusterController`'s property `clusterer`. By implementing the protocol `CCHMapClusterer`, you can provide your own strategy for positioning cluster annotations.

In addition, `CCHMapClusterController` by default reuses cluster annotations for a cell. This is beneficial for incrementally adding more annotations to the clustering (e.g. when downloading batches of data) because you want to avoid the cluster annotation jumping around during updates. Set `reuseExistingClusterAnnotations` to `NO` if you don't want this behavior.

### Cluster grouping

To have independent groups of clusters, more than one `CCHMapClusterController` can work on the same `MKMapView` instance. Each `CCHMapClusterController` can have its own settings.

```Objective-C
// First cluster controller
self.mapClusterControllerRed = [[CCHMapClusterController alloc] initWithMapView:self.mapView];
self.mapClusterControllerRed.cellSize = ...;
self.mapClusterControllerRed.marginFactor = ...;

// Second cluster controller
self.mapClusterControllerBlue = [[CCHMapClusterController alloc] initWithMapView:self.mapView];
self.mapClusterControllerBlue.cellSize = ...;
self.mapClusterControllerBlue.marginFactor = ...;
```

### Second-pass clustering

Clustering algorithm may result in visual overlapping of the cluster annotations illustrated on the example below:

<p align="center" >
  <img src="ClusterAnnotationsOverlap.png" alt="Cluster Annotations Overlapping" title="Cluster Annotations Overlapping"/>
</p>

If you wish to fix overlapping just set `approximatedAnnotationViewRadius` property of the `CCHMapClusterController` to the positive value in screen points. Second-pass algorythm assumes all annotations to be circles with the same radius and repositions annotations to prevent overlapping. Setting `approximatedAnnotationViewRadius` to zero disables second-pass clustering. Default value is 0, so second-pass clustering is disabled by default.

Result of the second-pass algorythm illustrated below:

<p align="center" >
  <img src="ClusterAnnotationsOverlapFixed.png" alt="Cluster Annotations Overlapping Fixed" title="Cluster Annotations Overlapping Fixed"/>
</p>

You can overwrite default second-pass algorythm by setting `fixAnnotationPosition` property of the `CCHMapClusterController` to the block of type `annotationPositionFixerBlock`.

### Dynamically disabling clustering

Sometimes it's helpful to disable clustering based on the current map data. This allows you to show unclustered annotations if needed. There are two properties for this purpose:

- `maxZoomLevelForClustering`: controls clustering for the entire map based on how far the map has been zoomed in. To disable clustering, set the `maxZoomLevelForClustering` property to the zoom level where you want clustering to stop. A zoom level of 0 means that the entire map fits the screen width and the value increases when zooming in. You can retrieve the current zoom level from `CCHMapClusterController`'s property `zoomLevel`. By default, `maxZoomLevelForClustering` is set to `DBL_MAX`, which means clustering is never disabled.
- `minUniqueLocationsForClustering`: controls clustering for a cell based on the number of unique locations in a cell. Clustering is disabled if the number of unique locations in a cell is below this value. By default, `minUniqueLocationsForClustering` is set to 0, which means clustering is never disabled.

The example in this project contains settings to experiment with these properties.

### Animations

By default, annotation views for cluster annotations receive an animation that fades the view in when added and out when removed (`CCHFadeInOutAnimator`). You can provide your own animation code by implementing the protocol `CCHMapAnimator` and changing `CCHMapClusterController`'s property `animator`.

### Code recipes

This list contains solutions to a number of issues that people have encountered. Feel free to ask additional questions by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/choefele/CCHMapClusterController/issues/new).

#### Finding a clustered annotation

A common use case is to have a search field where the user can make a choice from a list of matching annotations. Selecting an annotation would then zoom to its position on the map.

For this to work, you have to figure out which cluster contains the selected annotation. In addition, the clustering changes while zooming thus requiring an incremental approach to finding the cluster that contains the annotation the user is looking for.

`CCHMapClusterController` contains an easy to use interface to help you with this. Note that you have to use an annotation that has previously been added to the clustering:

```Objective-C
id<MKAnnotation> clusteredAnnotation = ...
[self.mapClusterController addAnnotations:@[clusteredAnnotation] withCompletionHandler:NULL];

...

[self.mapClusterController selectAnnotation:clusteredAnnotation andZoomToRegionWithLatitudinalMeters:1000 longitudinalMeters:1000];
```

#### Centering the map without changing the zoom level

`MKMapView` offers the method `setCenterCoordinate:animated:` to center the map on a new coordinate without changing the current zoom level. Unfortunately, this method doesn't work as advertised on iOS 7. Instead, calling it will zoom the map slightly thus causing the clusters to regroup with a different zoom level.

The following code avoids this problem:

```Objective-C
- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didSelectAnnotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)view
{
    MKMapPoint point = MKMapPointForCoordinate(view.annotation.coordinate);
    MKMapRect rect = [mapView visibleMapRect];
    rect.origin.x = point.x - rect.size.width * 0.5;
    rect.origin.y = point.y - rect.size.height * 0.5;
    [mapView setVisibleMapRect:rect animated:YES];
}
```

#### Receiving taps on annotation views

`mapView:didSelectAnnotationView:` behaves differently, depending on the state of the annotation view's `canShowCallout` property.

If `canShowCallout` is set to `YES`, a tap on the annotation view will open a callout. The map view will only call `mapView:didSelectAnnotationView:` if your annotation title is set to a non-zero-length string. For this reason, you will have to implement `mapClusterController:titleForMapClusterAnnotation:` to return a title for a cluster annotation.

If you don't want to show a callout on your annotation view, you have to set `canShowCallout` to `NO` (the default). Once you have done this, `mapView:didSelectAnnotationView:` will be called without setting a title.

One caveat is that the map view will remember the last selection. To be able to select the same annotation view again, you have to unselect its annotation first:

````Obj-C
- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didSelectAnnotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)view
{
    [mapView deselectAnnotation:view.annotation animated:NO];
}
````

#### Zooming in to a cluster

On iOS 7, you could use `showAnnotations:animated:`, but this will also add the given annotations to the `MKMapView`. Thus you will end up with all the clustered annotations on the screen _in addition_ to the clusters.

Instead, `CCHMapClusterAnnotation` offers the method `mapRect` that manually calculates an `MKMapRect` that includes all clustered annotations:

```Objective-C
- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didSelectAnnotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)view
{
    if ([view.annotation isKindOfClass:CCHMapClusterAnnotation.class]) {
        CCHMapClusterAnnotation *clusterAnnotation = (CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)view.annotation;
        MKMapRect mapRect = [clusterAnnotation mapRect];
        UIEdgeInsets edgeInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(20, 20, 20, 20);
        [mapView setVisibleMapRect:mapRect edgePadding:edgeInsets animated:YES];
    }
}
```

Use `CCHMapClusterController`'s `maxZoomLevelForClustering` property if you want to guarantee that each cluster annotation on the map will have one unique location when being zoomed in.

#### Showing callout accessory views for unclustered annotations only

This can be achieved by setting up the accessory views and then controlling their display status via the `canShowCallout` property.

```Objective-C
- (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id<MKAnnotation>)annotation
{
    MKAnnotationView *annotationView;

    if ([annotation isKindOfClass:CCHMapClusterAnnotation.class]) {
        annotationView = ...
        annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = ...

        CCHMapClusterAnnotation *clusterAnnotation = (CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)annotation;
        annotationView.canShowCallout = clusterAnnotation.isUniqueLocation;
    }
}

- (void)mapClusterController:(CCHMapClusterController *)mapClusterController willReuseMapClusterAnnotation:(CCHMapClusterAnnotation *)mapClusterAnnotation
{
    ClusterAnnotationView *clusterAnnotationView = (ClusterAnnotationView *)[self.mapClusterController.mapView viewForAnnotation:mapClusterAnnotation];
    clusterAnnotationView.canShowCallout = clusterAnnotation.isUniqueLocation;
}
```
